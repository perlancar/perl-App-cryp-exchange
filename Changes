0.011   2018-11-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Rename App::cryp::Exchange::{gdax,coinbasepro_lite}.

	- When account is not defined in configuration, allow continuing but use
          public_only=>1, so we can still access public API e.g. pairs,
          orderbook.

        - Add subcommands: create-limit-order, get-order, cancel-order.

	[API]

        - list_pairs(): add required record field: base_currency,
	  quote_currency, min_base_size, min_quote_size, quote_increment.

        [INTERNAL]

          make it more similar to native result returned by most exchanges
          ({sell=>[...], buy=>[...]}). Make result 2D-table (more viewable from
          CLI) only at the cryp-exchange level.

        - Support cryptopia.

        - bitcoin_indonesia: Replace Finance::BTCIndo & App::btcindo with Finance::Indodax &
