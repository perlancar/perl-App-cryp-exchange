	[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Rename subcommands: ls-balances -> balances, get-order-book ->
          orderbook, ls-pairs -> pairs, ls-exchanges -> exchanges, ls-accounts
          -> accounts.

	[NEW FEATURES]

        - Add subcommands: create-limit-order, get-order, cancel-order.

	[API]

        - list_pairs(): add required record field: base_currency,
	  quote_currency, min_base_size, min_quote_size, quote_increment.

        [INTERNAL]

        - Make subcommands modular/pluggable, so later we can create
          App-cryp-exchange-CmdBundle-Whatever.

	  ls-balances.

0.002   2018-04-12 (PERLANCAR)

        - [Incompatible change] Change structure of get_order_book() result to
          make it more similar to native result returned by most exchanges
          ({sell=>[...], buy=>[...]}). Make result 2D-table (more viewable from
          CLI) only at the cryp-exchange level.

        - Support cryptopia.

        - bitcoin_indonesia: Replace Finance::BTCIndo & App::btcindo with Finance::Indodax &
          App::indodax.
