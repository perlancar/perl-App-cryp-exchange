# ABSTRACT: Role for interacting with an exchange

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role describes the common API for interacting with an exchange that all
C<App::cryp::Exchange::*> modules follow.


=head1 ENVELOPED RESULT

All methods, unless specified otherwise, must return enveloped result:

 [$status, $reason, $payload, \%extra]

This result is analogous to an HTTP response; in fact C<$status> mostly uses
HTTP response codes. C<$reason> is analogous to HTTP status message. C<$payload>
is the actual content (optional if C<$status> is error status). C<%extra> is
optional and analogous to HTTP response headers to specify flags or attributes
or other metadata.

Some examples of enveloped result:

 [200, "OK", ["BTC/USD", "ETH/BTC"]]
 [404, "Not found"]

For more details about enveloped result, see L<Rinci::function>.


=head1 PROVIDED METHODS

=head2 to_canonical_currency

Usage:

 $xchg->to_canonical_currency($cur) => str

Convert native currency code to canonical/standardized currency code. Canonical
codes are listed in L<CryptoCurrency::Catalog>.

=head2 to_native_currency

Usage:

 $xchg->to_native_currency($cur) => str

Convert canonical/standardized currency code to exchange-native currency code.
Canonical codes are listed in L<CryptoCurrency::Catalog>.

=head2 to_canonical_pair

Usage:

 $xchg->to_canonical_pair($pair) => str

=head2 to_native_pair

Usage:

 $xchg->to_native_pair($pair) => str


=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 cancel_order

Usage:

 $xchg->cancel_order(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

Cancel an open order.

Known arguments (C<*> marks required arguments):

=over

=item * type*

=item * pair*

=item * order_id*

=back

=head2 create_limit_order

Usage:

 $xchg->create_limit_order(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

Create a buy/sell order at a specified price.

B<Specifying size (amount)>. When creating a buy order, some exchanges require
specifying size (amount) in quote currency, e.g. in BTC/USD pair when buying USD
we specify how much in USD we want to buy bitcoin. Some other exchanges require
specifying size in base currency, i.e. how many bitcoins we want to buy.
Similarly, when creating a sell order, some exchanges require specifying base
currency while others want size in quote currency. B<For flexibility, this role
method requires drivers to accept either base_size or quote_size.>

B<Minimum_size>. Exchanges have a minimum order size (amount) either in the
quote currency or base currency or both. Check the C<min_base_size> and
C<min_quote_size> field returned by L</"list_pairs">. The API server typically
will reject order when size is less than the minimum.

B<Maximum precision>. Exchanges also have restriction on the maximum precision
of price (see the C<quote_increment> field returned by L</"list_pairs">. For
example, if C<quote_increment> for C<BTC/USD> pair is 0.01 then the price
7000.51 is okay but 7000.526 is too precise. Some exchanges will reject
overprecise price, but some exchanges will simply round the price to the nearest
precision (e.g. 7000.524 to 7000.52) and some exchanges might round up or down
or truncate etc. B<For more consistent behavior, this role method requires
drivers to round down the overprecise price to the nearest quote increment.>

Known arguments (C<*> marks required arguments):

=over

=item * pair*

String. Pair.

=item * type*

String. Either "buy" or "sell".

=item * price*

Number. Price in the quote currency. If price is too precise, will be rounded
down to the nearest precision (see method description above for details).

=item * base_size

Specify amount to buy/sell in base currency. For example, in BTC/USD pair, we
specify how many bitcoins to buy or sell.

You have to specify one of base_size or quote_size, but not both.

=item * quote_size

Specify amount to buy/sell in quote currency. For example, in BTC/USD pair, we
specify how many USD to buy or sell bitcoins.

You have to specify one of base_size or quote_size, but not both.

=back

Some exchange drivers might provide additional options.

When successful, payload in response must be a hashref which contains at least
these keys: C<type> ("buy" or "sell"), C<pair>, C<order_id> (str, usually a
number, can also be a UUID, etc), C<price> (number, actual price of the order),
C<base_size> (actual size of the order, specified in base currency),
C<quote_size> (actual size of the order, specified in quote currency), C<status>
(current status of the order).

=head2 get_ticker

Usage:

 $xchg->get_ticker(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

Get a pair's last 24h price and volume information.

Known arguments (C<*> marks required arguments):

=over

=item * pair*

=back

When successful, payload in response must be a hashref which contains at least
these keys: C<high> (last 24h highest price), C<low> (last 24h lowest price),
C<last> (last trade's price), C<volume> (last 24h volume, in base currency),
C<buy> (last buy price), C<sell> (last sell price). Optional keys: C<open> (last
24h opening/first price), , C<quote_volume> (last 24h volume in quote currency).
Hash may contain additional keys. All prices are in quote currency, all volumes
(except C>quote_volume>) are in base currency.

=head2 data_canonical_currencies

Should return a hashref, a mapping between exchange-native currency codes to
canonical/standardized currency codes. All codes must be in uppercase. Used to
convert native pair/currency to canonical or vice versa. See also:
L</"data_reverse_canonical_currencies">.

=head2 data_native_pair_is_uppercase

Should return an integer value, 1 if native pair is in uppercase, 0 if native
pair is in lowercase. Used to convert native pair/currency to canonical or vice
versa.

=head2 data_native_pair_separator

Should return a single-character string. Used to convert native pair/currency to
canonical or vice versa.

=head2 data_reverse_canonical_currencies

Returns hashref, a mapping of canonical/standardized currency codes to exchange
native codes. All codes must be in uppercase. Used to convert native
pair/currency to canonical or vice versa.

This role already provides an implementation, which calculates the hashref by
reversing the hash returned by C</"data_canonical_currencies"> and caching the
result in the instance's C<_reverse_canonical_currencies> key. Driver can
provide its own implementation.

See also: L</"data_canonical_currencies">.

=head2 get_order

Usage:

 $xchg->get_order(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

Get information about a specific order.

Note that some exchanges do not allow getting information on order that is
already cancelled or fulfilled.

B<Identifying order.> Some exchanges provide UUID to uniquely identify an order,
while some others provide a regular integer and you must also specify pair and
type to uniquely identify a particular order. For consistency, this rule method
requires driver to ask for all of C<type>, C<pair>, and C<order_id>.

Known arguments (C<*> marks required arguments):

=over

=item * type*

=item * pair*

=item * order_id*

=back

Payload must be a hashref with at least these keys:

=over

=item * type

=item * pair

=item * order_id

=item * create_time

Foat. Unix epoch.

=item * status

Str. E.g.: C<open>, C<cancelled>, C<done>. TODO: standardize status across
exchanges.

=item * filled_base_size

Number.

=item * filled_quote_size

Number.

=back

=head2 get_order_book

Usage:

 $xchg->get_order_book(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

Method should return this payload:

 {
     buy => [
         [100, 10 ] , # price, amount
         [ 99,  4.1], # price, amount
         ...
     ],
     sell => [
         [101  , 5.5], # price, amount
         [101.5, 3.1], # price, amount
         ...
     ],
 }

Buy (bid, purchase) records must be sorted from highest price to lowest price.
Sell (ask, offer) records must be sorted from lowest price to highest.

Known arguments (C<*> marks required arguments):

=over

=item * pair*

String. Pair.

=back

=head2 list_balances

Usage:

 $xchg->list_balances(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

List account balances.

Method must return enveloped result. Payload must be an array of hashrefs. Each
hashref must contain at least these keys:

=over

=item * currency

fiat_or_crpytocurrency.

=item * available

num, balance available for trading i.e. buying.

=item * hold

num, balance that is currently held so not available for trading, e.g. balance
currently tied on open buy orders.

=item * total

num, usually C<available> + C<hold> but can also be C<available> + C<hold> +
C<pending_withdraw>. Generally not very useful.

=back

Hashref may also contain these keys: C<pending_withdraw> (balance that is in the
process of withdrawn to another exchange, etc), C<unconfirmed> (balance that has
recently been deposited but unconfirmed e.g. has not reached the minimum number
of confirmations).

Hashref may contain additional keys.

=head2 list_pairs

Usage:

 $xchg->list_pairs(%args) => [$status, $reason, $payload, \%resmeta]

List all pairs available for trading.

Method must return enveloped result. Payload must be an array containing pair
names (except when C<detail> argument is set to true, in which case method must
return array of records/hashrefs (see the C<detail> option for more details).

Pair names must be in the form of I<< <currency1>/<currency2> >> where
I<currency1> is the base currency and must be a cryptocurrency code while I<<
<currency2> >> is the quote currency and can be a fiat or cryptocurrency code.
Some example pair names: BTC/USD, ETH/BTC.

Known arguments (C<*> marks required arguments):

=over

=item * native
